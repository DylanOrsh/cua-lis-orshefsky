        <h2>Heuristic Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            This collection matched a lot of my expectations around how this kind of information could be displayed and accessed.
            <br> 
            Search results were well organized and intelligible, and things like filters and keyword entry were located in findable places. 
            <br>
            The large thumbnails, showing the front page of each issue item was a smart piece of aesthetic design that was immediately recognizable.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="browse.png"></img>
            <br>
            <br>
            Entering a misspelled term (such as “vienam” instead of “vietnam”) did yield a suggestion for the desired term (Error Prevention). 
            <br>
            Sorting options made sense and conformed to desires and expectations (match between system and real world). 
            <br>
            Navigation was simple, including going “back” pages. One small note on visibility of system status: the in-document keyword search displayed
            <br>
            “No results found” while still searching, only to be updated once it's done scanning the document, which is not ideal.
        </p>
        <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
        <h3> Strengths: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Browsing by date and finding specific issues by date is easy and direct.
            </li>
            <li>
                Search features are easy to find, easy to use, and conform to standard expectations for inputting filters and sort operations.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3> Weaknesses: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Keyword search is spotty at best; terms aren't being used in a manner consistent with a controlled vocabulary (World War II vs WW2 vs WWII)
            </li>
            <li>
                Metadata about contents of a given document is very light, verging on non-existent. The archive's metadata systems don't appear to include things like article titles,
                <br>
                or any other issue specific metadata, which weakens the relevance of search results.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Comparison</h2>
        <p>
            The results of the heuristic test were not very surprising to me. My tester noticed the same benefits that I did towards browsing, but also
            <br>
            found the search features to be lacking and sometimes frustrating. Even though the overall user interface was built with the same kind of pieces
            <br>
            as other similar systems, specific details of the implementation made it harder to use than they had expected. Overall, the struggle took place
            <br>
            more because of the specific nature of the collection's content, and how it had been indexed, rather than the overall sytem lacking the necessary tools.
