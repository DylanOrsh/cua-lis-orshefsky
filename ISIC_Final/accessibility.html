        <p>
            Accessibility in web design is an axis of technical and aesthetic design that cuts across specific feature-sets and gets at
            the heart of "usability". Accessibility in a search page can take many forms, and the National Gallery Library employs several
            key features in order to make their page more accesisbile to users with a variety of levels of ability, and to meet the standards set
            by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

            The most critical accessibility features on this page have to do with input methods. In addition to the text based search bar,
            there is the option to select an audio-based search term input. This increases the Operability of the page, and can enable users 
            who might struggle with a keyboard to enter their search terms via another method. The other key input feature is keyboard navigation. 
            All elements on the search page are navigable and selectable via the web-standard tab-and-arrow-keys method. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition to this base component, the site includes several "hidden" buttons
            that only become visible when navigating the page in this way (see below). These buttons enable quick travel across the page to specific high
            value locations within the search features and search results.
            <table border=2>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <img src="assets/main.png" height="75%" width="75%"></img>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <img src="assets/search.png" height="75%" width="75%"></img>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <img src="assets/results.png" height="75%" width="75%"></img>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <img src="assets/facets.png" height="75%" width="75%"></img>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br>
            <br>
            Although the site includes these features, and receives 
            <a href="https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/audit/?website=https%3A%2F%2Flibrary.nga.gov%2Fdiscovery%2Fsearch%3Fvid%3D01NGA_INST%3ANGA&flag=us">
                good marks</a>
            from accessibility standards checking programs, it is not without its faults in this area. The base text colors and fonts are well chosen
            for readability, but there is no built in method for text-resizing, or any true dedicated accessibility options menu at all. In addition 
            to this, some features are not successful on all browsers; within our project group, we had multiple users experience the "microphone" icon
            that enables the text-to-speech capability not appear at all. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Similarly, more advanced features such as search term suggestions and corrections (such as misspellings) are not well supported by these features.
            The "virtual browse" menu is another element on the item result page which does not respond as expected to keyboard navigation.
