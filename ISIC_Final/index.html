        <h2>Introduction/Overview</h2>
            <p>The National Gallery of Art Library, founded in 1941, accompanied the public opening of the National Gallery of Art with the mission 
                of supporting the institution’s staff members and visiting researchers in their curatorial and research needs. The NGA Library’s collection 
                contains 500,000+ books and periodicals on art, history, theory, architecture, and art criticism, particularly (though not exclusively) focusing 
                on Europe and the United States. The library is located within the East Building of the National Gallery and includes a study center, rare book room, 
                and library and image collections. The NGA Library also hosts an online catalog which can be searched on site or remotely and allows users to search 
                not only the library’s owned content but also its digital serial subscriptions, its extensive image collection, its auction catalogs, and more.
            </p>
            <br>
        <h2>Background: Behind the Scenes Tech</h2>
            <p>We reached out to the NGA Library staff via email and requested some technical information about their systems for this project. 
                Head of Technical Services at the National Gallery Library, Sarah Osborne Bender, volunteered to help answer our questions and 
                provide a behind-the-scenes look at their website.
            </p>
            <p>The library’s main web pages, like the broader NGA.gov site, are managed at the institutional level. This includes 
                the <a href="https://www.nga.gov/research/library.html">home landing page</a> along with the links to make appointments, contact librarians, 
                and view collection highlights. The <a href="https://library.nga.gov/discovery/search?vid=01NGA_INST:NGA">library search website</a> is managed 
                by NGA Libraries specifically. Their search system is powered by Ex Libris Primo VE discovery layer, which has been in use since November 2018. 
                This UI will be familiar to CUA students as it is the same system behind the CUA Libraries search site. Two additional services are used to help 
                present locally digitized collection content: 
                “an embedded <a href="https://iiif.io/get-started/iiif-viewers/">IIIF viewer</a> [International Image Interoperability Framework] delivers 
                image content into the bib record view. And the image files and image metadata is pulled from the institution's 
                digital asset management system, <a href="https://www.netx.net/">NetX</a>.”
            </p>
            <p>The public facing library and catalog search website does not interface with any collections or catalogs inside or outside of NGA as an institution; 
                it is a self-contained search system. The majority of the NGA Library collection is at least partially described and fully discoverable in the library 
                catalog, but NOT through the NGA.gov website search. It is important to note that within the Vertical File collection, however, records are described 
                at the folder level rather than the item level. Some items, especially within the expansive Image Collection, are described only at the “‘summary’ level 
                to at least indicate that image holdings exist for a particular artist or grouping.”
            </p>
            <p>Osborne Bender added that “Though there is not linkage or other exchange…our permanent collection is managed 
                using <a href="https://www.gallerysystems.com/tms-collections/tms-suite/tms/tms/">TMS collection management system</a> and our institutional 
                archives uses <a href="https://archivesspace.org/">ArchiveSpace</a>. Our conservation department 
                uses <a href="https://museumspace.com/conservationspace/">Conservation Space</a> for management of their data and images. None of these have 
                public-facing search layers, though our archives is moving in that direction.” She also let us know that a new version of the main NGA website 
                will be launched soon.
            </p>
            <p>One challenge experienced by the NGA Library staff with the library website is that, as part of a large institution with very controlled branding, 
                any edits made to the main library webpage are carried out by a separate technical department and cannot be controlled or carried out by library 
                staff outside of simply submitting change requests. However, the library search website in particular is under much more direct control of the library 
                staff: “We can change content and design on these pages, though we want seamless visual continuity with the rest of nga.gov. We can also make changes 
                to the configuration that impacts searching (what and how MARC fields are indexed, for example), change the bib record display to include local fields 
                or local field labels, add and remove functions (such as citation tools, etc).” Another challenge Osborne Bender described is the question of what search 
                scope to use as a default, with possibilities including just the “library” (print collection, subscribed online serials, purchased/licensed ebooks); the 
                auction catalog collection; the image collection; only items owned by the library (the current default); electronic and digital content only; and “everything.” 
                Each scope has its benefits and drawbacks for both the user and the librarians who are trying to ensure that the fullest extent of their collections are discoverable 
                and usable by their patrons.
            </p>
            <p>Some strengths of the system, in Osborne Bender’s opinion, are the high quality of their cataloging, the embedded viewer for digitized content, and 
                the power of their Primo VE search tool, all of which streamlines the process of connecting users to the content they are looking for. In the future, 
                NGA Library is hoping to connect the NGA Library resources with the broader resources of the National Gallery in one search interface. This “would 
                strengthen the meaning and relationships between original artworks, archival resources, scholarly publications, auction catalogs, conservation notes, and 
                images,” in keeping with a current trend among other libraries, museums, and cultural heritage institutions.

        <h2>Sean Search Etc.</h2>
            <p></p>
        <h2>Filters</h2>
	        <h3> In general</h3>
                <p>
                    The filtering section of a retrieval system is meant to refine the search that a user has requested. The NGA Library’s filtering 
                    system is specialized to meet the needs of art historians and that comes with advantages and disadvantages. A user can get very specific 
                    with their filtering tags and find the exact search result they are looking for with no other extraneous results if done correctly. A key 
                    component of the filtering system is how the filters update with each application. With each consecutive application, the filters become 
                    more and more specific and replace the old ones from previous applications.
                </p>
                <p>However, this is only true once you learn the specific filtering system of NGA and know exactly what content you are looking for. 
                    The disadvantages are that the user must learn the filtering system to use it effectively. Because it actively changes and updates 
                    what filters are available with each progressive application of filters, meaning the user will have to remember filters or refresh 
                    their search if they forget to add one and cannot find it again. 
                </p>
            <h3> Nielsen</h3>
            <p>Looking at Nielson’s Heuristics, it does well with #1, Visibility and System status, but needs improvement on #4, Consistency and Standards, 
                and #6, Recognition and Recall. 
                </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>#1. </dt>
                <dd>Its loading animations are minimal but consistent, and the active filters are shown above the filter selections.</dd>
                <dt>#4.</dt>
                <dd> Comparing it to the Mullen Library Search Catalog, the filtering system of NGA mostly meets standards, but deviates with its 
                    replacement filter system. When selecting a format, for example, the entire format section disappears after application and the 
                    user must delete the filter for it to return.
                </dd>
                <dt> #6.</dt>
                <dd>The replacement filter system forces the user to recall past filters in case they make a mistake and missed a needed filter.
                </dd>
            </dl>
        <h2>Item Metadata & Buttons</h2>
            <p>Overall, the buttons meet expectations. The endnote button can be confusing if someone does not know what it is. I tried sending an email 
                through the email button but didn’t receive anything, so it's inconclusive what it does. This could be something that requires the user 
                to be signed in, however, that is not notated. 
            </p>
            <p>The metadata can be spotty at times. As expected, information such as title, publisher, the standard number, the location in the library, 
                and how to access the item is consistently available for items. Metadata about what information the item provides is not always available 
                or easy to find.
            </p>

        <h2>Accessibility: Tools and Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                Accessibility in web design is an axis of technical and aesthetic design that cuts across specific feature-sets and gets at
                the heart of "usability". Accessibility in a search page can take many forms, and the National Gallery Library employs several
                key features in order to make their page more accesisbile to users with a variety of levels of ability, and to meet the standards set
                by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
                <br>
                <br>
                The most critical accessibility features on this page have to do with input methods. In addition to the text based search bar,
                there is the option to select an audio-based search term input. This increases the Operability of the page, and can enable users 
                who might struggle with a keyboard to enter their search terms via another method. The other key input feature is keyboard navigation. 
                All elements on the search page are navigable and selectable via the web-standard tab-and-arrow-keys method. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition to this base component, the site includes several "hidden" buttons
                that only become visible when navigating the page in this way (see below). These buttons enable quick travel across the page to specific high
                value locations within the search features and search results.
            </p>

                Although the site includes these features, and receives 
                <a href="https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/audit/?website=https%3A%2F%2Flibrary.nga.gov%2Fdiscovery%2Fsearch%3Fvid%3D01NGA_INST%3ANGA&flag=us">
                    good marks</a>
                from accessibility standards checking programs, it is not without its faults in this area. The base text colors and fonts are well chosen
                for readability, but there is no built in method for text-resizing, or any true dedicated accessibility options menu at all. In addition 
                to this, some features are not successful on all browsers; within our project group, we had multiple users experience the "microphone" icon
                that enables the text-to-speech capability not appear at all.

                Similarly, more advanced features such as search term suggestions and corrections (such as misspellings) are not well supported by these features.
                The "virtual browse" menu is another element on the item result page which does not respond as expected to keyboard navigation.
