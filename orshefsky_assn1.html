        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
            The International Children's Digital Library (ICDL) is a not-for-profit project started more than 20 years ago 
            with the mission to "support the world's children in becoming effective members of the global community... 
            by making the best in children's literature available online free of charge." The ICDL's current collection features
            over 4000 titles in more than 75 languages, each available for reading on their website via HTML pages which host JPEG scans.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ICDL is supported by the University of Maryland's Computer Science Department and iSchool, which provide the technical 
            support for the project, and are its primary maintainers as of 2021. The homepage for the project features several links to pages by which
            one can browse the available resources, ordered by title, language, genre, format, and more.
        </p>
        <h2>Users</h2>
        <p>
            The ICDL has several different user groups in mind who might want access to their archives:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Parents - looking for reading material for their children
                </li>
                <li>
                    Children - looking for reading material for themselves
                </li>
                <li>
                    Educators - looking for reading material to use with their classes
                </li>
                <li>
                    Researchers - looking for information on how the Digital Library has been used, and its impact 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>
                The ICDL mainly contains scans of books that are in the public domain. These books are accessible via a "web reader", built in HTML, 
                which allows for easy display of the pages and pagination between them. All of the books are related to childhood or appropriate for children, 
                although the level of difficulty and age appropriate-ness varies widely; picture books are catalogued alongside Charles Dicken's "A Christmas Carol",
                demonstrating a broad catalog, seeking to offer many different kinds of experiences.
                <br>
                <br>
                Each text's catalog entry includes the following basic information: title, author, language, genre, publisher, and contibutor. Many include a brief
                abstract, describing the text. Included alongside this catalog information on each book's page is a note explaining that the text is for personal
                use only, and does not cover any kind of secondary distribution.
                <br>
                <br>
                The website also features a separate section of content with links and references to research that has been done with the ICDL's catalog in
                conjunction with children and research groups, to measure the efficacy of the program. The majority of these papers and presentations are marked
                with dates from the mid to late 2000s.
            </p>
        <h2>Observations and Recommendations</h2>
            <p>
                The ICDL website has clearly not been updated to make use of a more robust Web 2.0 mindset, but the tools that are there still have some benefits.
                A "browse" rather than "search" model enables undirected discovery in a way that I think is in alignment with the mission of the organization,
                even if the latter approach is more common in the 2020s, given the improvement in database tooling and integrations that have happened in the decades since.
                <br>
                <br>
                One of the things that I think would have improved the experience while also being easy to manage with the existing tech would be some kind
                of "Featured" section on the homepage, which could make good use of the cover images that are included in the dataset, and provide another
                angle of discovery and engagement to the site experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some other small details that I think are well-thought-out include:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Two buttons - one on the header, one in the center of the homepage - that take you directly to the book list.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The browse by "real" vs "make-believe" link, which is an important distinction in specifically children's literature.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Strong button icons in the "reader" experience, which would be easy for small kids to use and understand.
                    </li>
            </p>
